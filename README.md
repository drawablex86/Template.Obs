# Obsidian plus Logseq
 A template repository for people who are interested in combining obsidian and logseq
 
 ## Why?
 Because obsidian is fast, it's graphy view is simply more beautiful and extensive plugin from the community. But logseq serves as the better outliner and block embeds work intuitively in it. Obsidian can be used for it's structured nature while logseq shines as a true zettelkasten style note taker. Why settle for one when you can have both.


## How to use?
The repo basically is an vault folder for obsidian and the logseq folder is named as "Zettelkasten". Fire up the templates.folder as vault for obsidian and open Zettelkasten folder inside Logseq and you are pretty much ready to do your thing. All new notes generated from obsidian will be saved to /zettelkasten/pages while the daily notes will go in /zettelkasten/journals. This ensures that both obsidian and logseq can read all the files. If you were to change the folder name for you logseq folder to something else make sure you correct the changes in daily notes and new notes section in obsidian settings.


## Templated and workflow
Will update incrementally as I am yet to proper document everything.
